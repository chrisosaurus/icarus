Icarus
======

Icarus is a toy typed compiled language


Plans
=====

* strong statically checked type system
* no 'holes' in the type system (null pointers be gone!)
* garbage collected
* multiple dispatch (dispatch to functions is based on function name and type of arguments passed)
* parametrized types
* union types (syntactic sugar for tagged enums, staticly checked before being taken apart)
