Ocaml:

* variant types


Perl:

* `obj->method()` => `namespace_of(obj)::method(obj)` shorthand

Pony:

* I had been considering forcing conditional expressions to be boolean, Pony helped convince me
* I was unsure of `if cond then ... end`, but Pony convinced me


Prolog:

* pattern matching (see `example/template_pattern.ic`)
