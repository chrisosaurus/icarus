`libs` contains unit tests for included libraries, we run these as part of our `make test`
`unit` contains c unit tests testing individual units of our code

both `libs` and `unit` are iterated through as part of `make test`, in order to add a test you can just drop it
into either of those 2 folders.


We also have a 'special' folder for tests which are not iterated through,
this is for tests that require many moving parts of possibly something other than c,
we call this folder `custom`.

An example of a test suited to `custom` is `test_example.pl` which also has a matching `test_example.c`,
`test_example.pl` runs `test_example.c` and captures the stdout in order to compare to the expected results
