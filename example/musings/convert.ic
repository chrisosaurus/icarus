# once again this is all early days, syntax and semantics not set in stone

# we want to be able specify functions for converting between types

type Foo
    a::Sint
end

# this requires being able to pass a Type as a value
# and be able to match on it for dispatch

fn convert(f::Foo Sint) :: Sint
    return f.a
end

fn convert(f::Foo String) :: string
    return convert(f.a String)
end

fn main()
    let f::Foo = Foo(14)

    print(convert(f String))
